Email Exercise

Please create an HTML page resembling a marketing email, using html and css. This is an email that the store sends to customers, notifying them of a sale.

The brand you are creating it for is called Birdy Grey and they sell bridesmaid dresses. 
This is their website: https://www.birdygrey.com/

Please follow these instructions:

The email needs to look appealing and have the same design language as the website.
The email needs to be mobile-responsive. 
The text for the email is as follows:
2020 is here and we’re having a flash sale!
All sale items are 50% off! Hurry up!
SHOP NOW
For inspiration, check out these beautiful wedding looks:

Love, Birdy Grey.
Feel free to add a header and/or footer for the email.
Feel free to use assets found on the store and on Birdy Grey’s social accounts. This includes logo, images, icons, fonts, color codes, etc.
We recommend subscribing to a mailing list on a few websites to see what these emails usually look like and get ideas.

Good luck!

Second exercise (Gorilla) - add this instruction “Make it mobile responsive using flexbox or grid.”
